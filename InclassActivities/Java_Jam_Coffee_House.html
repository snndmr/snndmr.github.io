    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>Anatolian rock (Turkish: Anadolu rock), also known as Turkish rock, is a fusion of Turkish folk and rock music. It emerged during the mid-1960s, soon after rock groups such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Status Quo and Omega became popular in Turkey. </p>
    <p>Examples of this style include Turkish musicians such as Cem Karaca, Barış Manço, Erkin Koray, Fikret Kızılok, Selda Bağcan, Erkut Taçkın, Cahit Oben, Selçuk Alagöz, Edip Akbayram alongside bands such as Moğollar, Silüetler, 3 Hürel, Kurtalan Ekspres, Grup Çığrışım, Grup Çağrışım, Mavi Işıklar, Apaşlar, Kaygısızlar, Haramiler, Modern Folk Üçlüsü and Kardaşlar. Today, Anatolian rock includes music derived from both traditional Turkish folk music and rock.</p>
